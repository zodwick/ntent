im tryna create a smart agentic screenshot app for android.
idea is that when i take a screenshot i need to send this iage to an LLM with custom context
then the llm suggests a few custom actions
we need to then take these actions. These can be:
1. screenshot of a food bill -> adds it to correct organised folder 
2. i take screenshot of an event in instagram - the app suggests adding this to calender -> adds it in one clik
3. chrome tech article  -> send this article in whatsapp to 3 friends (could be hardcoded for now)
4. i take screenshot of a film in google -> suggests adding to watchlist in letterboxd -> adds it


we can be super hacky with everything. we are gona 


all these actions should happen fully aurtomatically in the backround. the user should be able to click on the suggested action and continue using
not having to worry about anything or clicking anything. do it all yolo style for impressive demo
